NOW COMING TO THE MOST IMPORTANT CONCEPT I HAVE TO BE THROUGH IS OOPS IN C#

OOPS-
It is a design technique not a language feature
It tells you how to structure and design your software using:-
-real world objects
-relationship between objects
-oops pillars

Why OOPS?
Because real world systems are built from objects not functions

Class- 
A class is like a design, plan or blueprint
E.g. A car design is a Class
Actual cars(BMW )is object
It's a user defined data type that contains:-
1->Properties(data/state)
2->Methods(function/behaviour)

e.g.->
public class Cal
{
public int sum(int a ,int b)
{
return a+b;
}
}

Objects-

Object is an instance of class
It's created using new keyword
It allows access to class members using '.' operator

How to create a class and objects in C#?

Class Syntax:-

public ClassName
{
//fields
//properties
//methods
}

 Object Creation:-
ClassName obj=new ClassName();

TYPES OF CLASSES IN C#-
1->CONCRETE CLASSES-normal classes you can create objects from
2->ABSTRACT CLASSES-cannot create object must be inherited
3->SEALED CLASSES-cannot be inherited
4->STATIC CLASSES-all members must be static no object creation
5->PARTIAL CLASSES-class split across multiple files
