STATIC KEYWORD:-

Static are something that belongs to the class itself
They are created once in memory and can be shared by every member of that class

Why we need Static?
1-To reuse common Method/Properties
2-To avoid violating OOPS principles
3-To avoid creating unnecessary objects

CONST KEYWORD:-

Const are compile time constant
Values should be known at compile time
They are static by default
They cannot be assign in constructor
Value cannot change at runtime
It stays same for entire class

Where Const is stored?
Only one copy is created
Value is directly replaced into MSIL Code


READONLY KEYWORD:-

Its runtime constant
Values cannot change after initialization
It can be initialized either at time of declaration or inside constructor
Instance by default
It stays like variable
Its different for each object


CHECKED KEYWORD:-

"overflow checking is unchecked by default, but it is not correct to say all variables in C# are unchecked"
It enables overflow exceptions
It will throw overflow exception when overflow happens

UNCHECKED KEYWORD:-

It disables overflow exception
It forces C# Compiler to ignore overflow even when compiler normally checks it
