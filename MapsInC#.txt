#How to use a data structure that is equivalent to map in C++->That is done using Dictionary in C#
For C++ we use map<int,int>mp;
But for C# the syntax is quite different 
We use=>
Dictionary<datatype1,datatype2>Dictionary_Name=new Dictionary<dattype1,datatype2>();
//Now there can be different scenarios where we have to map are key to different values
1st Approach->Map keys with it's frequencies
  //way to initialize a predefined array with it's elements!
  
  int []arr={1,2,3,2,3,4,4,5,6};
  Dictionary<int,int>d=new Dictionary<int,int>d();
//foreach will refer each element in the array not it's index!
  foreach(int x in arr)
  {
    //Now here  is the difference we have to check whether the key exist or not 
    //If the key doesn't exist then we have to create the key else we can update the value
    if(!d.ContainsKey(x))
      {  
      d[x]=0;
      d[x]++;
      }
    else
      {
      d[x]++;
      }
  }
2nd Approach ->Map the key with its index
int []arr={1,2,,3,4,5,6,6};
Dictionary<int,int>d=new Dictionary<int,int>();
for(int i=0;i<arr.Length;i++)
{
d[arr[i]]=i;
}
3rd Approach->Map each index with element
int []arr={1,2,3,4};
Dictionary<int,int>map=new Dictionary<int,int>();
for(int i=0;i<arr.Length;i++)
{
map[i]=arr[i];
}

    
//These are very basics concept to get the map(Dictionary)in C#
