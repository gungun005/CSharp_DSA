ENCAPSULATION IN C#

It means keep data safe by hiding it and allowing controlled access
In C# Encapsulation binds data (variable) and behaviour(methods)inside a single unit like class, struct ,interface etc

Encapsulation=>Grouping data+ Methods Together + Restricting direct access

Why Encapsulation is important?
->protects data
->prevents misuse
->validates data
->makes code flexible
->gives you control over what values are acceptable or not

Real World E.g.=>capsule medicine, school bag

VERY BASIC E.g. in C#-
class Bank
{
public long AcctNo;
public string Name;
public int Balance;
public void GetBalance()
public void Deposit()
public void Withdraw()
}
//Here variables and methods are grouped together

DATA HIDING:-
Hides internal data from direct access
Allows access only through method/properties
We use:-
1->Private variables-cannot be accessed directly
2->Public methods/properties-to access private data safely


e.g. USING SETTER AND GETTER METHODS
public class Bank
{
//variable
private double Balance;
//methods
public double GetBalance()
{
return balance;
}
public void SetBalance(double balance)
{
this.balance=balance;
}
}
class Program
{
public static void Main()
{
Bank bank=new Bank();
bank.SetBalance(500);
Console.WriteLine(bank.GetBalance);
}
}


Why we are using Setter /Getter in C#->
As we can validate are values
e.g->
public void SetAmount(int Amount)
{
if(Amount>0)
{
this.amount=Amount;
}
}

e.g. IMPLEMENTING ENCAPSULATION USING PROPERTIES


C# offers properties so you don't need separate getter /setter
e.g-> 
public class Bank{
private double Amount;
public double Amount
{
get {return Amount;}
set{
if(value<0)
throw new Exception("only positive values");
}
}
}
It means hiding data and allowing controlled access using methods /properties to keep data safe
