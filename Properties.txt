PROPERTIES IN C#:-

A property is a class member with "controlled accessors"
They can validate data
They can get and set the values
It encapsulates private fields

WHY WE NEED THEM ?

If we expose our fields as public everyone can access it and set invalid values so we declare fields as private and expose them
as properties


TYPES OF PROPERTIES-
1->Read only:-

contains only get

e.g.->public int ID
{
get{return id;}
}

2->Write only:-

contains only set
e.g.->public int ID
{
set{marks=value;}
}

3->Read-Write Only:-

contains get and set both
e.g.->
public int ID{
get{return marks;}
set{marks=value;}
}

4->Auto-Implemented Property:-

when no extra logic is needed C# automatically creates a hidden private field
e.g.->
public int Age{get;set;}


ACCESSORS IN C#-

They are special methods inside a property

1->SET ACCESSOR-used to assign value to private fields
2->GET ACCESSOR-used to return the value of private fields

TYPES OF ACCESSORS:-

1->Symmetric:-Both Accessors(means get n set) have same visibility
2->Asymmetric:-Different visibility for get n set

DEFAULT ACCESIBILITY OF ACCESSORS:-
It inherits the property's access modifier unless explicitly changed
