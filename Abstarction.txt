ABSTRACTION IN C#-
MANY CONCEPTS SUCH AS
1->ABSTRACT CLASS
2->ABSTRACT METHODS
3->OVERRIDE
4->NEW 
5->VIRTUAL 
6->ABSTRACT
7->COMMON MISTAKES DONE IN INTERVIEW
THESE ALL CONCEPTS ARE MENTIONED IN THE NOTEBOOK IN DETAIL REFER THEIR

Show only necessary things and hide the complex things
The user should know what the feature does the user should not see how it works internally
You expose only required services
We keep implementation hidden
How to implement Abstraction in C#-
It can be done using two ways-
1->Using Interface(100% Abstraction)
2->Using Abstract Classes(0-100% Abstraction)

1->Implement Abstraction Using Interface

STEP1- Create an interface with method name only (no implementation)

e.g.=>
public interface IBank{
void ValidateCard();
void WithdrawMoney();
}
//user knows about what service exist not how they work

STEP2-Write a factory to hide object Creation

e.g.=>public class BankFactory{
public static IBank GetBankObject(string banktype)
{
if(banktype=="SBI")
return new SBI();
else if(banktype=="AXIS")
return new AXIS();
return NULL;
}
}
STEP 3-SBI implements Interface
Step4-AXIS implements Interface
Step5-Main method uses interface
Step6-User Sees IBank User cannot see how Sbi/Axis methods are written

2->Implement using Abstract Class

Here we define an abstract class with abstract methods
e.g->
public abstract class IBank
{
public abstract void ValidateCard();
public abstract void WithdrawMoney();
}
//child classes implement these methods
public class SBI:IBank
{
public override void BankTransfer()
{
Console.WriteLine("SBI BANK");
}
public override void CheckBalance()
{
Console.WriteLine("SBI CHECK");
}
}
